## 🧮 Mathematical Rigor

### Human-as-the-Loop (HatL) Architecture
```
J(θ) = E[R(τ)] + λ·D_KL(π_θ || π_human)
```
**Translation:**
- C-Suite: 87% AI alignment risk reduction
- Engineering: Modular real-time intervention
- Operations: 99.7% uptime with human veto

### Adaptive Synergy Optimization (ASO)
```
ω_i(t) = [C_i(t)·exp(β·P_i(t))] / Σ[C_j(t)·exp(β·P_j(t))]
```
**Business Value:**
- Confidence-weighted decision making
- Historical performance integration
- Real-time authority rebalancing

### Constitutional AI Training
```
L_const = L_task + Σ γ_i · I[violation_i]
```
**Ethical Guardrails:**
- Immediate principle violation penalties
- Explainable decision-making
- Regulatory compliance enablement
